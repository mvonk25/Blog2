SynopsisAdele Geras has written two historical fiction novellas under the series called History Girls, Troy and Ithaka. Each book is a retelling of a historical event from Greek history as if the Greek Gods were very much real, as the meddle in the lives of mortals. With vitality and grace, Adele Geras breathes personality, heartbreak and humor into this classic story, told through the eyes of the women of Troy and Ithaka.</description>

SynopsisEvery April, when the wind blows from the sea and mingles with the scent of lilacs, Landon Carter remembers his last year at Beaufort High. It was 1958, and Landon had already dated a girl or two. He even swore that he had once been in love. Certainly the last person in town he thought he’d fall for was Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the town’s Baptist minister.</description>

      <description>After downloading the following packages:
library(Lahman)library(sqldf)## Loading required package: gsubfn## Loading required package: proto## Loading required package: RSQLitelibrary(ggplot2)The first step is to extract the data from Lahman.
query&amp;lt;-&amp;quot;SELECT weightFROM Master&amp;quot;result&amp;lt;-sqldf(query)Now the data has been saved under results. The next step is to write the commands for visualizing the data.
ggplot()+geom_histogram(data=result,aes(x=weight))## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.</description>

SynopsisThe world has suffered a magic apocalypse. We pushed the technological progress too far, and now magic returned with a vengeance. It comes in waves, without warning, and vanishes as suddenly as it appears. When magic is up, planes drop out of the sky, cars stall, electricity dies. When magic is down, guns work and spells fail.
It’s a volatile, screwed-up world. Magic feeds on technology, gnawing down on skyscrapers until most of them topple and fall, leaving only skeletal husks behind.</description>
