SynopsisAdele Geras has written two historical fiction novellas under the series called History Girls, Troy and Ithaka. Each book is a retelling of a historical event from Greek history as if the Greek Gods were very much real, as the meddle in the lives of mortals. With vitality and grace, Adele Geras breathes personality, heartbreak and humor into this classic story, told through the eyes of the women of Troy and Ithaka.</description>
